All your original ad cards (every category, every title, description, expiry text)
The full post-ad form (all fields, labels, checkboxes, button)
The exact navbar wording and layout
The exact hero wording
The exact CTA banners wording
The search/filter bar exactly as it was

So we are not losing anything — we are merging your full original content into the new polished style.
Below is the corrected, complete index.html that:

Uses the new visual style you love
Contains 100% of your original ad cards (all categories, all text, all expiry data)
Contains your full post-ad form (nothing cut)
Has the new ad detail popup modal (click card → shows full details + gallery for premium)
Has 4 premium fake cards at the top (with gallery)
Has verified badges & online dots on some cards
Has the floating WhatsApp button
Has the age verification modal
Has the quick message modal as fallback
Filter code is kept but commented out so cards are visible locally (we'll fix it properly next)
